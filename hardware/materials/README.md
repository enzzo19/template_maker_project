# Hardware Materials

This section contains information about various materials and components used in the construction of our hardware. From actuators and connectors to batteries, sensors, and mechanical pieces, this section provides details about the essential building blocks of our project.

## About Hardware Materials

The Hardware Materials section serves as a repository of information about the materials and components used in the construction of our project's hardware. These materials play vital roles in powering, connecting, sensing, and moving various parts of the hardware, contributing to its functionality and performance.

## Categories of Hardware Materials

1. **Actuators**: Actuators are devices that convert electrical signals into mechanical motion. They are used to control movement, such as opening and closing valves, rotating motors, or extending and retracting mechanisms.

2. **Connectors**: Connectors are components used to join or interface different parts of the hardware, allowing for electrical or mechanical connections between modules, sensors, actuators, and power sources.

3. **Batteries**: Batteries are power sources that provide electrical energy to the hardware, enabling it to function autonomously or in remote locations where access to external power is limited or unavailable.

4. **Sensors**: Sensors detect and measure physical phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, light, or motion, and convert them into electrical signals that can be processed and analyzed by the hardware.

5. **Mechanical Pieces**: Mechanical pieces include various mechanical components, such as brackets, fasteners, gears, pulleys, and structural elements, used to support, position, or constrain parts of the hardware assembly.

## Contents of Each Category

Each category within the Hardware Materials section includes information about specific types of materials and components, including their properties, specifications, applications, and recommended usage guidelines. Detailed documentation, datasheets, and resources are provided to assist users in selecting, integrating, and operating these materials effectively.

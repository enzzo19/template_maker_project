# PCB Design

This section contains resources related to the design and fabrication of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) for our project. PCB design is a crucial aspect of electronics development, enabling the creation of compact and reliable electronic circuits for various applications.

## About PCB Design

Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are essential components in modern electronics, providing a platform for mounting and interconnecting electronic components. PCB design involves creating a layout of electrical connections and traces on a board, ensuring proper functionality, signal integrity, and manufacturability of the final product. Effective PCB design considers factors such as component placement, signal routing, layer stack-up, and design for manufacturability (DFM) to produce high-quality PCBs.

## Components of PCB Design

1. **Schematic Capture**: Software tools for capturing circuit schematics and creating a graphical representation of electronic components and their interconnections.

2. **PCB Layout**: Software tools for designing the physical layout of a PCB, including component placement, routing of electrical traces, and creation of copper layers.

3. **Design Rule Checking (DRC)**: Tools for performing design rule checks to ensure that the PCB design complies with manufacturing constraints and specifications.

4. **Gerber Files**: Standard file format used to convey PCB design information to manufacturing processes, including copper traces, solder mask, and silkscreen layers.

## How to Use PCB Design Software

1. **Schematic Capture**: Use the software's schematic editor to create a graphical representation of your circuit, including electronic components and their interconnections.

2. **PCB Layout**: Transfer the schematic to the PCB layout editor and place components on the board, route traces to connect components according to the schematic, and optimize the layout for signal integrity and manufacturability.

3. **Design Rule Checking (DRC)**: Perform design rule checks to identify and correct errors or violations in the PCB design, ensuring compliance with manufacturing constraints and specifications.

4. **Generate Gerber Files**: Generate Gerber files from the PCB design software, including copper layers, solder mask, silkscreen, and drill files, to prepare for PCB fabrication.

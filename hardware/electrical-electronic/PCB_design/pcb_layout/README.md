# PCB Layout

This section contains resources related to the physical layout design of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) for our project. PCB layout design is a critical step in the development process, as it determines the physical arrangement of components and routing of electrical traces on the PCB.

## About PCB Layout

PCB layout design involves placing electronic components onto the PCB and routing electrical connections between them to create a functional circuit. Effective PCB layout design considers factors such as component placement, signal integrity, power distribution, thermal management, and manufacturability to produce high-quality PCBs that meet design requirements.

## Components of PCB Layout

1. **Component Placement**: The process of positioning electronic components onto the PCB in a way that optimizes signal integrity, thermal performance, and ease of assembly.

2. **Trace Routing**: The process of creating electrical connections (traces) between components on the PCB while considering factors such as signal integrity, impedance matching, and EMI/RFI mitigation.

3. **Layer Stackup**: The arrangement of copper layers and dielectric materials within the PCB, including considerations for signal layers, power planes, and ground planes.

4. **Design for Manufacturability (DFM)**: The incorporation of design elements and considerations that facilitate the fabrication and assembly of the PCB, such as minimum trace widths, annular ring sizes, and solder mask clearances.


## How to Use PCB Layout Software

1. **Component Placement**: Use the PCB layout software to place electronic components onto the PCB, considering factors such as signal integrity, thermal management, and manufacturability.

2. **Trace Routing**: Route electrical connections (traces) between components on the PCB, ensuring proper signal integrity, impedance control, and EMI/RFI mitigation.

3. **Layer Stackup**: Define the layer stackup of the PCB, including signal layers, power planes, and ground planes, to optimize electrical performance and manufacturability.

4. **Design Rule Checking (DRC)**: Perform design rule checks to identify and correct errors or violations in the PCB layout, ensuring compliance with manufacturing constraints and specifications.

## Description

### design_files/
This directory contains CAD files (.STEP, .IGES, .DXF, etc.) for CNC machining. These files are specifically designed for use with CNC machines and may include features such as toolpaths, feeds, and speeds.

### toolpaths/
This directory includes G-code files or other instructions for CNC machining. These files define the toolpaths and operations necessary to machine the parts from the CAD designs.

### material_specifications.md
This document provides specifications for materials suitable for CNC machining. It includes information on material properties, compatibility with CNC processes, and recommended cutting parameters.

### manufacturing_guidelines.md
This document offers guidelines and best practices for CNC machining and manufacturing. It covers topics such as design considerations, tool selection, fixturing, and quality control measures.

### design_software.md
This document lists recommended software tools for CNC design and machining. It includes both free and paid software options, along with brief descriptions of their features and capabilities. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced designer, you'll find a tool that suits your needs in this list.


## Usage
- Use the CAD files in `design_files/` to generate toolpaths for CNC machining.
- Refer to the toolpath files in `toolpaths/` for instructions on machining the parts.
- Consult `material_specifications.md` for information on suitable materials for CNC machining.
- Follow the guidelines in `manufacturing_guidelines.md` to ensure successful CNC machining and manufacturing.

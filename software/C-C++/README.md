## Introduction

[Provide a brief introduction to the project and its purpose.]

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **include/**: Contains header files (.h) for public interfaces.
- **src/**: Contains source files (.cpp) for implementation code.
- **test/**: Contains test files for unit testing.
- **lib/**: Contains external libraries used in the project.

## Configuration Files

- **platformio.ini**: Configuration file for PlatformIO project settings.
- **.clang-format**: Configuration file for code formatting rules.
- **.gitignore**: File specifying which files and directories to ignore in version control.

## Building and Compiling

To build and compile the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the appropriate PlatformIO commands to build the project:
   - `pio run`: Build the project.
   - `pio run -t upload`: Upload firmware to a target device.
   - `pio run -t clean`: Clean the project (remove build artifacts).
   
## Testing

The project includes unit tests located in the `test/` directory. To run the tests, execute the following command:

pio testation code.
- **test/**: Contains test files for unit testing.
- **lib/**: Contains external libraries used in the project.

## Configuration Files

- **platformio.ini**: Configuration file for PlatformIO project settings.
- **.clang-format**: Configuration file for code formatting rules.
- **.gitignore**: File specifying which files and directories to ignore in version control.

I recommend use PlatformIO like framework development to work with C/C++ projects, is a useful tool, easy to use.

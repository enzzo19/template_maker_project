# Firmware

This section is dedicated to the development of Arduino sketches and code that serve as the backbone of our project's embedded systems. Firmware plays a crucial role in controlling hardware components, implementing algorithms, and managing communication between various subsystems to ensure the proper functioning of our project.

## Contents

The Firmware directory is organized to facilitate the management and development of the Arduino codebase. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

### Main Firmware Files

The **Main Firmware Files** directory contains the primary Arduino sketches that orchestrate the overall operation of our project's embedded systems. These sketches serve as the main entry points of the firmware and are responsible for coordinating different subsystems, executing high-level control algorithms, and responding to external inputs. Examples of tasks performed by main firmware files include sensor data acquisition, actuator control, decision-making logic, and user interface management.

### Utility Functions

The **Utility Functions** directory houses reusable code snippets and utility functions that are used across multiple firmware files. These utility functions encapsulate common operations such as data processing, error handling, calibration routines, and communication protocols. By centralizing commonly used functionalities in utility functions, we promote code reuse, improve code readability, and facilitate maintenance tasks. Utility functions abstract low-level operations and provide higher-level interfaces for interacting with hardware peripherals, processing data, and managing system state.

### Peripheral Drivers

The **Peripheral Drivers** directory contains Arduino libraries and code files that provide drivers for interfacing with hardware peripherals. Hardware peripherals include sensors, actuators, displays, communication modules, and other external devices connected to the Arduino microcontroller. Peripheral drivers abstract low-level hardware interactions, encapsulate communication protocols, and provide high-level interfaces for controlling and interacting with peripherals. Each peripheral driver encapsulates the functionality and behavior of a specific hardware component, allowing firmware developers to interact with peripherals using simple function calls and abstracted interfaces.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Firmware section from members of our project community. If you have additional firmware files, utility functions, or peripheral drivers to contribute, feel free to edit the documentation or submit a pull request. Your contributions play a vital role in improving the functionality, reliability, and maintainability of our project's firmware. By collaborating and sharing code, we can collectively enhance the capabilities of our project and empower others in the maker community to build upon our work.

Feel free to explore the Firmware section to access and contribute to the firmware files used in our project. If you have any questions, suggestions, or ideas for improving the firmware, don't hesitate to reach out to our project team.

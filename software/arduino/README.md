# Arduino

This section contains firmware and libraries developed for Arduino microcontrollers. Arduino is a popular platform for prototyping and developing embedded systems, offering a wide range of hardware compatibility and a user-friendly development environment.

## Subdirectories

### Firmware

The Firmware directory contains Arduino sketches and code developed for our project's embedded systems. Arduino firmware is responsible for controlling hardware components, implementing algorithms, and interfacing with sensors and actuators to perform specific tasks.

### Libraries

The Libraries directory contains custom Arduino libraries developed for our project. Arduino libraries encapsulate reusable code and functionalities, providing an efficient way to organize and manage code modules for common tasks such as sensor interfacing, communication protocols, and device drivers.

# Install Folder

The `install/` directory contains the installed files after building and installing the ROS project. These files are typically generated by the build system (e.g., CMake) during the installation process and include executable binaries, libraries, headers, and other resources required to run the project.

## Explanation

- **Installed Files**: The `install/` directory contains the final output of the build process, including executable binaries, libraries, headers, and other artifacts.
  
- **Generated During Installation**: These files are generated by the build system when the project is installed, usually using the `make install` command or similar installation targets.

- **Ready for Deployment**: The files in the `install/` directory are ready for deployment on the target system, where the ROS project will be executed.

- **Not for Manual Modification**: Developers should not modify files in the `install/` directory manually. Any modifications or updates should be made to the source code or build configuration files and then rebuilt and installed.

## Usage

- **Deployment**: The contents of the `install/` directory are typically deployed to the target system where the ROS project will be executed. This can be done manually or through automated deployment scripts.

- **Version Control**: It's not necessary to include the `install/` directory in version control, as it contains generated files that can be easily regenerated during the installation process.

- **Cleanup**: Developers can safely delete the `install/` directory and regenerate it by rebuilding and reinstalling the project when needed.

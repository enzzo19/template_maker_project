# Log Folder

The `log/` directory contains log files generated by the ROS project during runtime. These log files capture diagnostic messages, warnings, errors, and other output produced by nodes and components of the project.

## Explanation

- **Log Files**: The `log/` directory contains text files that store runtime logs generated by the ROS project.
  
- **Captures Diagnostic Information**: Log files capture diagnostic messages, warnings, errors, and other output produced by nodes and components during runtime.

- **Useful for Debugging**: Log files are useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues in the ROS project. They provide insights into the runtime behavior of nodes and help identify errors or anomalies.

- **Managed Automatically**: Log files are typically managed automatically by the ROS logging system, which configures log levels, file rotation, and other settings.

## Usage

- **Debugging**: Developers can use log files to debug issues in the ROS project by examining the recorded messages and identifying any errors or unexpected behavior.

- **Monitoring**: Log files can be monitored in real-time during project execution to track the performance and behavior of nodes.

- **Retention Policy**: It's important to define a retention policy for log files to prevent them from consuming excessive disk space. Older log files may be archived or deleted periodically to free up storage.

- **Log Rotation**: Consider configuring log rotation settings to manage the size and number of log files generated by the project, ensuring that logs are efficiently managed and retained.

# Source Folder

The `src/` directory contains the source code files of the ROS project. This directory typically includes all the ROS packages, nodes, launch files, message definitions, service definitions, and other source files necessary for the project.

## Explanation

- **Source Code Files**: The `src/` directory contains all the source code files of the ROS project, organized into ROS packages and subdirectories.

- **ROS Packages**: Each subdirectory within `src/` represents a ROS package, which may contain nodes, launch files, message definitions, service definitions, and other related files.

- **Modular Structure**: Organizing the project's source code into ROS packages allows for a modular and scalable project structure, making it easier to manage and maintain.

- **Building Blocks**: ROS packages serve as building blocks of the project, encapsulating specific functionalities and components that can be reused and composed to build complex robotic systems.

## Usage

- **Development**: Developers work within the `src/` directory to write, edit, and manage the source code of the ROS project. They can create new ROS packages, add nodes, define messages and services, and organize files as needed.

- **Version Control**: The contents of the `src/` directory are typically version controlled using a version control system such as Git. This allows for collaboration, tracking changes, and managing project history.

- **Building**: The source code in `src/` is used to build the ROS project using tools such as `catkin_make` or `catkin build`. These tools compile the source code, generate binary executables, and create other necessary artifacts for running the project.

- **Testing**: Developers can run tests on the source code in `src/` to ensure its correctness and functionality. Unit tests, integration tests, and system tests can be written and executed to validate the behavior of the project components.

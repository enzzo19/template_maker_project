# src/ Directory

The `src/` directory typically contains the source code files for the ROS nodes and packages developed as part of your ROS project. This directory plays a central role in organizing the codebase and implementing the functionality of your ROS system.

## Explanation

- **ROS Nodes**: ROS nodes are executable files that perform specific tasks within the ROS ecosystem. They communicate with each other via topics, services, and actions to achieve the desired behavior of the system.

- **Package Source Files**: Each ROS package within the `src/` directory may contain source files (e.g., C++, Python) responsible for implementing the package's functionality. These files define the behavior of nodes, services, messages, and other components of the package.

- **Custom Libraries and Utilities**: The `src/` directory may also contain custom libraries, utilities, or helper functions shared among multiple ROS packages. These files encapsulate reusable functionality and promote code modularity and maintainability.

- **External Dependencies**: If your ROS project depends on external libraries or packages not provided by the ROS ecosystem, you may include their source files or links to them within the `src/` directory. This ensures that all necessary dependencies are available for building and running your ROS nodes.

## Example

Here's an example of what you might find in the `src/` directory:

```
src/
├── package_name1/
│ ├── node1.cpp
│ ├── node2.py
│ ├── library1.cpp
│ ├── library2.py
│ └── external_dependency/
│ ├── dependency_header1.h
│ └── dependency_source.cpp
└── package_name2/
├── node3.cpp
├── node4.py
├── utility.py
└── external_dependency/
├── dependency_header2.h
└── dependency_source.cpp
```

In this example:
- `package_name1/` and `package_name2/` are ROS packages containing source files for nodes, libraries, utilities, and external dependencies.
- `node1.cpp`, `node2.py`, `node3.cpp`, and `node4.py` are executable files defining ROS nodes responsible for specific tasks.
- `library1.cpp`, `library2.py`, and `utility.py` are source files containing reusable code shared among nodes or packages.
- `external_dependency/` directories contain source files of external dependencies required by the ROS packages.

The `src/` directory serves as the foundation of your ROS project, housing the source code files necessary for implementing the functionality of your ROS nodes and packages.

It's essential to maintain a well-organized and documented `src/` directory to facilitate code development, collaboration, and maintenance efforts within your ROS project.

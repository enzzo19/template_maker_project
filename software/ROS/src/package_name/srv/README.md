# srv/ Directory

The `srv/` directory contains service definition files used in ROS for defining custom service types. Services allow nodes to send requests and receive responses from other nodes, enabling more complex interactions in a ROS system.

## Explanation

- **Service Files**: Service files define the structure of custom service types used by ROS nodes. They specify the format of requests and responses exchanged between nodes in a ROS system.

- **Service Types**: Service types consist of a request message and a response message. The request message specifies the data sent by the client to the server, while the response message specifies the data returned by the server to the client.

- **Service Definitions**: Service definitions are written in a simple text-based format specific to ROS. They typically have a `.srv` extension and follow a syntax similar to message definitions.

- **Compilation**: Service files are compiled into language-specific code (e.g., C++, Python) using the `rossrv` command-line tool. This generates language-specific classes or modules that can be used to define and implement ROS services in nodes.

## Example

Here's an example of what you might find in the `srv/` directory:

```
srv/
├── CustomService1.srv
├── CustomService2.srv
└── CustomService3.srv
```

In this example:
- `CustomService1.srv`, `CustomService2.srv`, and `CustomService3.srv` are service files defining custom service types used in the ROS package.

These service files define the structure of custom services exchanged between nodes in the ROS system. They specify the format of requests and responses, allowing nodes to interact and provide services to each other.

It's important to document the purpose and structure of each service file to ensure clarity and maintainability of your ROS project.

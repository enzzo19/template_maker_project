# msg/ Directory

The `msg/` directory contains message files used in ROS for defining custom message types. Messages are used to define the structure of data passed between ROS nodes, enabling communication between different parts of a ROS system.

## Explanation

- **Message Files**: Message files define the structure of custom message types used by ROS nodes. They specify the fields and data types of messages exchanged between nodes in a ROS system.

- **Message Types**: Message types can represent various data structures, including simple data types (e.g., integers, floats), arrays, nested structures, and custom-defined data types.

- **Message Definitions**: Message definitions are written in a simple text-based format specific to ROS. They typically have a `.msg` extension and follow a syntax similar to C/C++ struct definitions.

- **Compilation**: Message files are compiled into language-specific code (e.g., C++, Python) using the `rosmsg` command-line tool. This generates language-specific classes or modules that can be used to create, send, and receive messages in ROS nodes.

## Example

Here's an example of what you might find in the `msg/` directory:

```
msg/
├── CustomMessage1.msg
├── CustomMessage2.msg
└── CustomMessage3.msg
```

In this example:
- `CustomMessage1.msg`, `CustomMessage2.msg`, and `CustomMessage3.msg` are message files defining custom message types used in the ROS package.

These message files define the structure of custom messages exchanged between nodes in the ROS system. They specify the fields and data types of messages, allowing nodes to communicate effectively.

It's important to document the purpose and structure of each message file to ensure clarity and maintainability of your ROS project.

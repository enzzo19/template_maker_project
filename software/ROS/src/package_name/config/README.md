# config/ Directory

The `config/` directory contains configuration files used by nodes within the ROS package. These files often contain parameter settings, calibration data, or other configuration information necessary for the nodes to operate correctly.

## Explanation

- **Parameter YAML Files**: Parameter YAML files specify parameters used by nodes in the package. They are often in YAML format and may contain key-value pairs representing various settings.

- **Launch Files with Parameters**: Launch files can also include parameters for nodes. These parameters can be loaded from separate YAML files or defined directly within the launch file.

- **Configuration Scripts**: Sometimes, configuration scripts written in Python or other scripting languages are used to dynamically generate or modify parameters based on runtime conditions.

## Example

Here's an example of what you might find in the `config/` directory:

```
config/
├── parameters.yaml
├── example_launch.launch
└── config_script.py
```

In this example:
- `parameters.yaml` specifies parameters for nodes in the package.
- `example_launch.launch` is a launch file with parameters for launching nodes.
- `config_script.py` is a Python script for dynamic parameter generation.

These are just examples, and the actual files and their contents may vary based on the specific requirements of your ROS package.

It's important to document the purpose and usage of each configuration file to ensure clarity and maintainability of your ROS project.

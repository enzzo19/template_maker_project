# include/ Directory

The `include/` directory contains header files (`*.h`) used by C++ packages within the ROS package. These header files define interfaces, declarations, constants, and other elements necessary for compilation and interaction with other parts of the package or external packages.

## Explanation

- **Header Files for C++ Packages**: These files contain declarations of classes, functions, variables, and other elements defined in the corresponding source files (`*.cpp`). They are included in other C++ source files to provide access to the declarations.

- **Interface Definitions**: Header files may define interfaces for classes or modules within the package. Interfaces specify the public methods, properties, and behaviors that can be accessed by other parts of the package or external packages.

- **Constants and Macros**: Header files may also define constants, macros, or inline functions that are used throughout the package. These definitions help improve code readability, maintainability, and consistency.

- **External Libraries**: If your package depends on external libraries, you may include header files from those libraries in the `include/` directory. This allows your package's source code to access the functionality provided by the external libraries.

## Example

Here's an example of what you might find in the `include/` directory:

```
include/
├── package_name/
│ ├── my_class.h
│ ├── my_utility.h
│ └── project_config.h
├── external_library/
│ ├── library_header1.h
│ └── library_header2.h
```

In this example, `my_class.h`, `my_utility.h`, and `project_config.h` are header files specific to the `package_name/` package, while `library_header1.h` and `library_header2.h` are header files from an external library included in the package.

The contents of the `include/` directory are typically used during the compilation process to ensure that all necessary declarations are available to the compiler.

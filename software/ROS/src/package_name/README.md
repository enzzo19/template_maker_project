# Package Name

The `package_name/` directory is a ROS package within the `src/` directory of the project. This package contains all the source code, configuration files, launch files, message definitions, service definitions, and other resources specific to the functionality provided by this package.

## Explanation

- **ROS Package**: `package_name/` represents a ROS package, which is a fundamental unit of ROS software organization. It encapsulates a set of ROS nodes, configuration files, and other resources that together provide a specific functionality or capability.

- **Source Code**: The package contains source code files written in programming languages such as C++, Python, or others, depending on the requirements of the project.

- **Configuration Files**: Configuration files, such as launch files (`*.launch`), parameter files (`*.yaml`), and configuration scripts, are included in the package to configure and launch nodes and set parameters.

- **Message and Service Definitions**: Message definition files (`*.msg`) and service definition files (`*.srv`) define custom message types and service interfaces used by nodes within the package.

## Package Contents

### config

The `config/` directory contains configuration files used by nodes within the package. These files may include parameter files (`*.yaml`) or other configuration scripts necessary for node initialization and operation.

### launch

The `launch/` directory contains ROS launch files (`*.launch`) used to launch nodes and configure the ROS environment. Launch files specify which nodes to run, with what parameters, and in what order.

### include

The `include/` directory typically contains header files (`*.h`) for C++ packages or other include files necessary for compilation. Header files define interfaces and declarations used by other parts of the package or external packages.

### msg

The `msg/` directory contains message definition files (`*.msg`) that define custom message types used for communication between nodes within the package or with external packages.

### src

The `src/` directory contains the source code files (`*.cpp`, `*.py`, etc.) for nodes, libraries, and other components of the package. This is where the implementation of the package's functionality resides.

### srv

The `srv/` directory contains service definition files (`*.srv`) that define custom service types used for requesting or providing services between nodes within the package or with external packages.

## Usage

- **Development**: Developers work within the `package_name/` directory to write, edit, and manage the source code and resources of the ROS package. They implement the functionality provided by the package and ensure its correctness and efficiency.

- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and system tests can be written and executed to verify the functionality of the ROS package. Test files (`test_*.py` for Python or `*_test.cpp` for C++) can be included in the package for this purpose.

- **Documentation**: It's important to maintain documentation within the package to describe its purpose, functionality, usage, and any specific instructions for developers or users.

- **Version Control**: The contents of the `package_name/` directory are version controlled using a version control system such as Git. This allows for collaboration, tracking changes, and managing project history.

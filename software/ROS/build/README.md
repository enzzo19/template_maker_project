# Build Folder

The `build/` directory contains all the intermediate build files generated during the compilation process of the ROS project. These files are generated by the build system (e.g., CMake) and are used to create the final executable or library files.

## Explanation

- **Intermediate Build Files**: The `build/` directory contains various intermediate files, including object files, libraries, and other artifacts generated while compiling the source code.
  
- **Generated Automatically**: These files are generated automatically by the build system based on the instructions provided in the `CMakeLists.txt` files within each ROS package.

- **Temporary Storage**: The `build/` directory serves as temporary storage for build artifacts and can be safely deleted without affecting the project's functionality.

- **Not for Manual Modification**: Developers typically do not need to interact with or modify files in the `build/` directory directly. Any modifications should be made to the source code or build configuration files instead.

## Usage

- **Automatic Generation**: The contents of the `build/` directory are generated automatically when building the project using the build system. For ROS projects, this is often done by running commands such as `catkin_make` or `catkin build`.

- **Version Control**: It's essential to include the `build/` directory in the project's `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to version control. This helps keep the repository clean and avoids unnecessary storage of generated files.
